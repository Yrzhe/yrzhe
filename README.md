# Hey, I'm Adrian 👋

**AI Tool Entrepreneur & Independent Developer**

I build things with AI and think about the cognitive traps we fall into while doing so.

## What I Do

I'm a AI PM @YouWare working at the intersection of **AI tooling**, **developer experience**, and **human cognition**. I believe the real bottleneck in the AI era isn't technical execution—it's clarity of thought, taste, and knowing when to stop.

Currently building with Claude Code, modern web technologies, and edge computing architectures.

## Philosophy

I call myself a "Foolish Philosopher"—someone who builds things while questioning the assumptions behind them.

A few beliefs I hold:

- **AI compresses execution, not clarity.** The hard part was never coding; it's knowing what you actually want to build.
- **"Good enough to ship" beats "perfect but stuck."** Motion creates learning. Paralysis creates nothing.
- **Tools get stronger. Cognitive traps get subtler.** The better AI becomes, the easier it is to mistake "can do" for "should do."

## Let's Connect

I share insights on AI tools, cognitive biases, and the craft of building things that matter.

That's where I post demos, half-formed thoughts, and occasional rants about why most AI discourse misses the point.
